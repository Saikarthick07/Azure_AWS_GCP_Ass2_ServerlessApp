# CST8917 â€“ Serverless Applications

# Cloud Serverless Services Comparison

## Objective

This document compares the **Microsoft Azure** serverless services used in the "Serverless Application" course with their **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** equivalents.  
The goal is to highlight similarities and differences in **features, triggers/bindings, integration options, monitoring**, and **pricing** for real-world architecture decisions.
